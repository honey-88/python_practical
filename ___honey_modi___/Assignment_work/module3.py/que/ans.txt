1) What is List? How will you reverse a list?
-> list which is contain similar and dis-similar data elements

2) How will you remove last object from a list?
-> Using pop () The simplest way to remove last element from list in Python is to use the pop () method.

3) Suppose list1 is [2, 33, 222, 14, and 25], what is list1 [-1]?
-> -1

4) Differentiate between append () and extend () methods?
-> Append(): Add element in exisiting list .Append accepts all
   data types and adds only one element to the list.
            syntax:
                list_var.append(element)
   Extend():Extend accepts only iterable types and
   appends all elements to the list.
            syntax:
                list_var.extend(element)

5) How will you compare two list?
-> l1 = [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]  
   l2 = [12, 13, 11, 15, 14]  
 
a = set(list1)  
b = set(list2)  
 
if a == b:  
    print("The list1 and list2 are equal")  
else:  
    print("The list1 and list2 are not equal")  

6) why do we use zip() method in python?
-> It is used to map the similar index of multiple containers so that they can be used just using a single entity.
   Syntax : zip (*-------)
